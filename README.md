# The project is still in development, so it may not work as expected. If you want to help, open an issue or a pull request.

## Main Points:
- keep status of exploits running!!! (running time, output, number of flags obtained)
- easy web config with autoconfig script upload option
- pip library exploitfarm (that is both cli (aka xfarm -u url ./exploit) and python library)
- one-command deploy (donwload docker-compose, and start it using curl)

## TODO:
- Add autoconfig feature in python library
- Test xfarm on windows
- Finish python lib
- Develop the front-end side

## Future works
- Upload tar of exploit to share it with other players or run it remotely
- exploit versioning
